# aos-man
Manual page script for Piqueserver.

## Usage
Install the script as usual, by putting the `manpage.py` file into your `scripts` directory. In your configuration directory, create a `man` directory to hold your manual pages. A manual page is a plain text file, named like `<page name>.<section number>`, e.g. `man.1` for a manual page named `man` in section `1`. A manual page for the script itself is provided both as usage documentation and as an example of a manpage file.
